    <p><i>“Bloody rain, when does it stop?”</i></p>

    <p>The town is quiet, too quiet, perhaps. One might think, “Well it’s midday, someone’s gotta rest.” Still, no one is to be found, except for us and the birds.</p>

    <p><i>“Where are they?”</i></p>

    <p>The swings at the play ground sway elegantly in the spring breeze. The sky continue to water our heads, gallons upon gallons.</p>

    <p><i>“Where are they?”</i></p>

    <p>Despite the warm rain, birds continue to chirp, joining the rain in the grand symphony of nature–a sad one, perhaps, but grand. Denton, then, is a jungle surrounded by fields of emptiness.</p>

    <p><i>“Are they, the residents, just intoxicated by the silence and the alluring beauty that the trees around them seem too happy to provide?”</i></p>
