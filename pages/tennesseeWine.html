        <h1>Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Association v. Thomas: An Analysis</h1>
        <p><i>October 30th, 2019</i></p>

    </center>

    <p>In the case of Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Association v. Thomas (Tennessee Wine v. Thomas), the U.S. Supreme Court holds that Tennessee’s 2-year residency requirement for out-of-state retail license applicants “violates the Commerce Clause and is not shielded by §2 of the Twenty-first Amendment” and because it “blatantly favors the State’s residents and has little relationship to public health and safety, it is unconstitutional” (2).</p>

    <p>The issue arose when two businesses, Total Wine and Affluere, applied for licenses to own and operate liquor stores, neither of which “satisfied the durational-residency requirements” (Syllabus 4). The Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Commission (TABC) staff recommended approval of the applications but the Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Association (the Association) “threatened to sue the TABC if it granted them.” In retaliation, the executive director of TABC filed a “declaratory judgment action in state court” to settle the dispute, the case of which was later moved to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, which “concluded that the requirements are unconstitutional” (Syllabus 1 & 4). As the State declined to appeal, Total Wine and Affluere were granted licenses (4). The Association, however, took the case to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which affirmed the decision, albeit with a divided panel (5). Nonetheless, The Association “filed a petition for a writ of certiorari challenging the decision on the 2-year residency requirement for initial licenses,” of which the Supreme Court granted “in light of the disagreement among the Courts of Appeals about how to reconcile our modern Twenty-first Amendment and dormant Commerce Clause precedents” (6).</p>

    <p>As mentioned before, the Supreme Court, whose opinion was delivered by Justice Alito, affirmed the decision and held that the Commerce Clause “also prohibits state laws that unduly restrict interstate commerce” (6). In its defense, the Association attempts to argue that Section Two of the Twenty-first Amendment “was intended broadly to exempt all in-state distribution laws from dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny,” a sentiment echoed by the dissent (29). The Supreme Court rejected this position, maintaining that the Association and the dissent did not “take into account the overly expansive interpretation of §2 that took hold for a time in the immediate aftermath of its adoption” (29). By the late 19th century, “the Court was firmly of the view that the Commerce Clause by its own force restricts state regulation of interstate commerce” as past records of state conventions also “[provided] no evidence that §2 was understood to give States the power to enact protectionist laws” (15, 21). As such, states could not “encroach upon Congress’s ‘power to regulate commerce among the several States’” (15). In addition, the Supreme Court has acknowledged that “§2 grants States latitude with respect to the regulation of alcohol, but the Court has repeatedly declined to read §2 as allowing the States to violate the ‘nondiscrimination principle’” (26). Furthermore, the Court also found the requirements poorly-designed, as the Association could not “explain why a proprietor who lives in Bristol, Virginia, will be less knowledgeable about the needs of his neighbors right across the border in Bristol, Tennessee, than someone who lives 500 miles away in Memphis” (35). Thus, Tennessee’s residency requirement “expressly discriminates against nonresidents and has at best a highly attenuated relationship to public health or safety” (33). As a result, it “violates the Commerce Clause and is not saved by the Twenty-first Amendment” (37).</p>

    <p>The Supreme Court’s ruling on Tennessee’s 2-year residency requirement for out-of-state liquor retailers has undoubtedly had economic and constitutional implications. As trade barriers are removed, out-of-state businesses can establish their presence in the state of Tennessee more easily. The possible influx of businesses will effectively promote competition within the state and hinder the potential creation of state-sponsored monopoly should the requirement in question remain. As a result, consumers in Tennessee will be able to access “‘hundreds and thousands of wines’” previously restricted by the state’s protectionist measures. In addition, newly arrived out-of-state residents will be able to make an honest living selling alcoholic beverages to support themselves and their families (Sibilla).</p>

    <p>It is also important to note that the Supreme Court’s ruling has created a ripple effect throughout the alcohol industry in the United States. Residency requirements regarding the sales of alcohol in other states, ranging from “30 days in South Carolina to five years in Indiana and Oklahoma,” may soon be removed as a consequence of Tennessee Wine v. Thomas (Sibilla). This nationwide removal of trade barriers, as discussed above, will potentially encourage inter- and intrastate commerce and ultimately provide consumers with more choices.</p>

    <p>In light of less restrictive state regulations on alcohol, one may raise concerns about their potential effects on public health. However, as mentioned before, Tennessee’s restrictions were found to have little to do with public health but rather with state protectionism (33). In addition, while the presence of a licensing system may theoretically improve public health, the reality is that such systems have only encouraged governmental bodies worldwide to “increase the availability of alcohol by increasing the number of licences to produce, distribute and sell alcohol,” effectively negating any conceivable benefit (Ghebreyesus 100). Therefore, in terms of protecting public health, regulations from the state of Tennessee were entirely redundant.</p>

    <p>In conclusion, Tennessee’s residency requirements for out-of-state businesses were ineffective in combating alcohol-related problems, hindered interstate commerce, and thus violated the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court’s ruling on Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Association v. Thomas will certainly have an effect on similar restrictions placed on the sales of alcohol in other states.</p>
