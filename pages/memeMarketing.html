    <h2>Abstract</h2>

    <p>Meme marketing (MM) is the practice of promoting a product or service using memes, an Internet-based phenomenon involving viral pieces of user-generated content, including image, articles, and video or audio clips. This latest form of viral marketing is starting to gain prominence in recent years following the infiltration of social media into everyday life thanks to the rapid advancement in communication technologies and dissemination thereof. As more people are exposed to and becoming part of the Internet culture, a bid to appeal to this growing audience can be an attractive use of resources for those wishing to advertise through meme marketing. The following thesis attempts to provide a historical background of memes through the examination of previous studies and academic literature in addition to an analysis of current manifestations of meme marketing on popular social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. In addition, a survey targeting University of Northern Iowa students and an assortment of online and social media users has been conducted to gauge the attitudes towards real-world use of MM and to explore the relationship between said attitudes and other online or Internet-related behaviors. This quantitative study found no apparent links between meme consumption habits and attitudes toward MM, as age is the only reliable predictor of the latter: younger people are more negative towards the use of memes for commercial purposes.</p>

    <p>Keywords: <i>meme, meme marketing, viral marketing, social media, resource</i></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Viral marketing, while not exclusive to the Internet, is a uniquely online phenomenon. Due to its ability to spread product awareness quickly and widely, akin to a virus, and its effectiveness being somewhat independent of marketing investment, viral marketing is highly popular with companies seeking to promote their products on the Internet, particularly through social media. In recent years, as the online landscape has evolved, with social media leading the charge, viral marketing has also taken on new forms as companies try to take advantage of an increasingly massive customer base. One such form of viral marketing, representing the latest in the evolution of the online landscape, is “meme marketing,” a phenomenon where companies would use internet memes to advertise products and/or brands by means of using, repurposing, or creating memes as well as engaging in activities that could be considered “meme-able.”</p>

    <p>Given the premises, this thesis attempts to explain meme marketing generally in the English-speaking sphere through the documentation of the history of memes, how memes intertwine with viral marketing, and whether or not meme marketing is an effective strategy that is also sustainable for most companies. On the receiving end of marketing, how people view meme marketing and how they can potentially contribute to its virality will also be studied.</p>

    <p>The Internet, being a culture in and of itself, has become an integral part of modern society. With a user base in the billions, the Internet also represents a tremendous opportunity for companies to advertise products. As such, knowledge gained as part of the research conducted by this thesis into the Internet culture will surely be of use for companies wishing to make a big splash online.</p>

    <h2>Literature review</h2>

    <h3><i>What’s in a Meme?</i></h3>

    <p>Despite being most associated with the recent Internet culture, the concept of memes predates the Internet itself. The term meme was first coined by biologist Richard Dawkins in 1976 as “a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation.” As such, memes can include “tunes, ideas, catch-phrases, clothes, fashions, ways of making pots or of building arches” that can be propagated from person to person (Dawkins, 2016, p. 249). From this premise, Zanette et al. (2019) also asserted that memes “evolved to become complex artefacts that are rich in cultural meanings and popular references” (p. 158).</p>

    <p>Memes, like any other form of content, follow certain formats: most memes are composed of “an image juxtaposed with a written caption (both image and text can be modified during transmission), which carries an ironic, politically incorrect, and sometimes grotesque message” (Zanette et al., 2019, p. 159). While Dawkins certainly did not intend for memes to be a strictly online phenomenon, due to the integration of advanced communication technologies into the modern society, memes as of this writing most exclusively refer to digital videos, images, and other user-generated content that can be and are shared online, and will henceforth be referred to as such.</p>

    <p>Indeed, as the Internet grew, so did memes, which were split into many different genres, including photo fads, LOLCats, stock character macros, and rage comics, among others (Shifman, 2013, pp. 100-118). Though the means of creating memes have become increasingly accessible, to the point that “even a six-year-old can operate,” this endeavor requires “meme literacy:” certain genres “can be understood (and created) by almost anyone, whereas others require detailed knowledge about a digital meme subculture” (Shifman, 2013, p. 100). Similarly, memes can also be interpreted as a means of intra-group communication in which “humorous social commentaries which are contextually relevant to a particular demographic of individuals” are depicted (Umair et al., 2020, p. 2).</p>

    <h3><i>The Internet Culture</i></h3>

    <p>As memes have evolved “in parallel with the web itself,” the Internet has provided “an environment conducive to the emergence of a participatory culture” (Zanette et al., 2019, p. 159). Bebić and Volarevic (2018) concurred earlier, further adding that the Internet’s “flexibility, ubiquitous presence, and accessibility enable users to transform existing memes and create new ones very easily” (p. 45). Given how memes can propagate freely and quickly on the Internet, it is important to examine how the Internet culture was created by and contributed to the proliferation of memes.</p>

    <p>The Internet culture, as a whole, is nearly impossible to pinpoint due to the sheer number of people using it: as of July 2020, 4.57 billion people were active Internet users, most of whom come from China, India, and the United States (Clement, 2020). However, from a meme-centric perspective, such a culture is largely homogeneous around the world in terms of the memes’ content and purposes, and thus more open to crystallization. As mentioned above, memes are an expression of the beliefs held by particular communities and/or demographic groups. Waddock (2018), using the broader definition of memes, that is originally devised by Dawkins, posited that memes “frame how people think about the world around them, shaping attitudes, ideologies and belief systems, and, ultimately, behaviors and practices” (p. 18).</p>

    <p>One of the most salient cultural identity of the Internet associated with memes is trolling, which is “the act of disrupting online conversations for the sake of doing so (just for the lulz), even if it includes harassing people or perpetuating controversial discourses” (Zanette et al., 2019, p. 159). Fostered in a subculture environment known as “4chan,” trolls have been responsible for many popular memes, such as the aforementioned LOLCats, Advice Animals, and rage comics, etc. (Philips, 2015, p. 137). However, it is the motive behind these memes that provides an insight into the mindset of these meme pioneers, and subsequently the Internet culture itself. Philips (2015) noted that trolls have an “impulse to juxtapose death and destruction with pop-cultural iconography.” For example, following the September 11 attacks, 4chan trolls “fetishized” the event, producing the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <p><i>World Wrestling Federation wrestlers smashing the towers to bits; Will Smith as the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air tap dancing as the first tower falls; Kanye West scolding both towers (“Yo al Qaeda, I’m a really happy for you, and I’mma let you finish. . .but the war of 1812 was the best attack on US soil of all time!”); Nyan Cat at the moment of impact (“Nyan 11: Nevar Forget”); Where’s Waldo careening out of the dust clouds wearing a troll mask; the Kool-Aid man emerging from the rubble; Obi-Wan Kenobi making racist jokes about “sand people”; the just-stricken towers crudely animated to look like two stick figures smoking a joint" (p. 117).</i></p>
    </ul>
    

    <p>Due to the use of inside jokes, for a long time, memes were inaccessible to outsiders. However, as Internet memes became more popular with ordinary Internet users, or went “mainstream,” trolling, though still being a salient part of the Internet culture, has been relegated to more obscure corners of the Internet. The first salvo signaling the democratization of memes was rung by Know Your Meme (KYM), a “go-to resource for everything memetic.” KYM was explicitly created for the uninitiated with “detailed, almost clinical explanations of the Internet’s most popular participatory content” (Philips, 2015, pp. 139). In addition, thanks to meme-making tools such as Meme Generator, people previously unfamiliar with memes can create and share their own memes quickly and efficiently (Zanette, 2019, p. 159).</p>

    <p>With new audiences come new trends. As memes move away from in-jokes and obscure references, they become the vessel wherein the modern zeitgeist manifests itself. Most notable of the new waves of memes is “relatable memes” which document “the stresses of college, self-image issues, or the mundane aspects of office jobs.” Relatable memes either take the forms of “starter packs” which list stereotypical attributes of a certain subject, or “My Face When” which depicts common reactions using stock photos paired with captions specifying the context. This social aspect of memes has also turned memes into a new type of social currency: the more a person knows about memes, the more that person is considered trendy and popular (Lamphere, 2018, pp. 30-31).</p>

    <h3><i>Viral Marketing</i></h3>

    <p>Sometimes, certain things become popular in a very short time. Wharton School Professor of Marketing Jonah Berger identified six factors behind virality:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Social Currency: do things make people look good in social situations?</li>
        <li>Triggers: are things associated with common aspects of people’s lives? </li>
        <li>Emotion: do things appeal to people’s emotions?</li>
        <li>Public: can things be seen and imitated easily?</li>
        <li>Practical Value: do things contain useful information?</li>
        <li>Stories: are things integral to stories that people tell? (Berger, 2013).</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>As things go viral and catch the attention of a significant audience, there are incentives for businesses to tap into the potentials of viral content. Indeed, in a marketing context, the use of viral content, as the name suggests, is often exclusive to the concept of viral marketing (VM). Noting that the definition of VM varies among scholars due to the concept’s novelty, Sohn et al. (2013) offers to create a unifying definition where VM is a “marketer-initiated consumer activity that spreads a marketing message unaltered across a market or segment in a limited time period mimicking an epidemic” (p. 22).</p>

    <p>The benefits and drawbacks of VM have also been widely discussed. In a research conducted by Cruz and Fill (2008), the advantages of VM are “lower levels of investment (costs) involved in developing campaigns and its ability to reach a large number of people, relatively quickly” while the most visible disadvantage of VM is “the relative lack of control over the message and its distribution, depending on placement” (p. 750). Lekhanya (2014) concurred with the latter, noting that “it is not easy to control information obtained via viral marketing” (p. 227). In contrast, Tucker (2015) implied that the low cost of viral marketing has prompted companies to switch “their emphasis on paid media, such as online display advertising, to earned media where consumers transmit the message” (p. 294).</p>

    <p>As scholars have also conducted research into word of mouth (WOM), representing an emphasis on interpersonal influence which is believed to be central to the understanding of VM, a conclusion is reached: social networks play a significant role in how information is spread (Allsop et al., 2007, p. 410). When a notable social change is recognized and its effects observed, the origin of such a change is often sought out (Watts & Dodds, 2007, p. 455). Groeger and Buttle (2014) also noted that homophily, a principle in which people tend to develop close relationships with others similar to them, may “predispose the spread of WOM among relatively homogenous social network members” (p. 1201). This principle may also explain why relatable memes have been at the forefront of recent memetic developments, as noted later on by Lamphere.</p>

    <p>Based on these findings regarding interpersonal communication and social networks, it is clear that the Internet, with its ability to massively streamline communication, has had an impact on VM. Indeed, the usage of new media, specifically the Internet, appears to amplify the impacts of WOM (Allsop et al., 2007, p. 399). In addition, social media on the Internet have also become go-to platforms for modern VM campaigns (Grifoni et al., 2013, p. 24).</p>

    <h3><i>“Memejacking” or Meme Marketing (MM)</i></h3>

    <p>As discussed above, memes represent a form of cultural transmission. Memes can only persist if they are viral themselves, “a symptom of the recursive process of memetic reproduction” (Wiggins & Bowers, 2014, p. 8). Zanette et al. (2019) echoed this sentiment, adding that the original meme can become “a text of reference to be quoted and changed along its circulation” (pp. 160-161). Given these characteristics and coupled with the benefits of VM, Internet memes, created with the purpose to be spread far and wide, are the epitome of viral content and thus incredibly suitable as a VM tool.</p>

    <p>Indeed, in the twilight of the aforementioned 4chan-dominated Internet culture and the early proliferation of social media usage, “memejacking,” in which “marketers appropriate existing content for branding purposes,” took hold. This practice, marking the beginning of the corporatization and the subsequent democratization of memes among the masses, was met with frustration from 4chan’s founder as well as self-proclaimed meme enthusiasts (Philips, 2015, pp. 139-141). Memes were no longer for fun, as they are now marketable and in many cases, profitable.</p>

    <p>Despite pushback, “memejacking,” or its more comprehensible counterpart “meme marketing” (MM), which will be used henceforth, has evolved and is here to stay. As of this writing, a Google search for the term “meme marketing” shows numerous articles detailing how companies can take advantage of memes for their marketing needs. Regardless, in the age of social media in the latter half of the 2010s onwards, detailed studies on how companies have been using meme marketing remain scant and inaccessible.</p>

    <h3><i>Sustainable Competitive Advantages</i></h3>

    <p>As MM is a relatively new phenomenon, and as such not extensively studied, whether or not MM is a worthwhile endeavor remains to be seen. However, existing models can predict whether or not companies will achieve and maintain sustained competitive advantages.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the most widely accepted framework regarding competitive advantages is the resource-based view (RBV), which focuses on a firm’s internal resources as a source of competitive advantage. The RBV identifies four key characteristics of a company’s resources that determine the potential for sustained competitive advantages:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Value: a firm’s resources are valuable when these “enable a firm to conceive of or implement strategies that improve its efficiency and effectiveness.”</li>
        <li>Rarity: a firm’s resources are rare when these are restricted to a few firms or unobtainable by most firms.</li>
        <li>Imitability: a firm’s resources are imitable when its competitors can create similar resources that enable the implementation of identical strategies. Imitability depends upon one or a combination of following factors: historical conditions (how the firm obtains its resources), causal ambiguity (how the firm creates sustainable competitive advantages from a firm’s resources), and social complexity (the social conditions beyond a firm’s influence that are needed to create sustainable competitive advantages).</li>
        <li>Non-substitutability: there must be no “strategically equivalent valuable resources that are themselves either not rare or imitable” (Barney, 1991, pp. 106-111).</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>As memes, or rather the employment of memes by companies, can be considered a resource, the RBV model is particularly appropriate for the analysis regarding the benefits of MM. Indeed, a RBV discussion about MM will be discussed further in this thesis.</p>
