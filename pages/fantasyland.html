    </center>

    <p>Fantasyland narrates five hundred years of American history in an attempt to highlight peculiar traits that set the U.S. apart from the rest of the world, particularly regarding why many Americans seem to favor fantasy over reality, thus living entirely in Fantasyland.</p>

    <p>To explain this phenomenon, it is important to understand that America “was the dreamworld creation of fantasists … with a freakish appetite for the amazing” (427). Populating the blank canvas of the New World from a religiously persecuted Protestant background, Americans have developed a strong sense of anti-establishment, moral superiority derived from biblical literalism, susceptibility to fantastical myths, entrepreneurism, spectacles, conspiracies, and delusional nostalgia. Coupled with a narrow interpretation of the Enlightenment ideal of individualism, Americans have also invented their own realities and succumbed to the “fantasy-industrial complex,” turning the U.S. into an elaborate reality-television show (113). Free from any serious opposition, such a fantasy-driven mindset has historically produced lasting real-world consequences, prominently in the form of pseudoscience, economic recessions, and political extremism (178, 370, 412). The latest product of Fantasyland is conveniently condensed in Donald Trump, the current President of the United States whose reality-television background, beliefs, and administrative policies are adored by fantasists, including the religious right, conspiracy theorists, ultranationalists, and racists (417). Furthermore, Fantasyland’s status as a superpower has also allowed American fantasies to be exported globally. As it seeks to fulfill biblical wishes, Fantasyland has freely meddled in foreign affairs and destabilized global politics (374). Moreover, as a result of Americans’ irrational fear of foreign influence, international institutions and laws have been rendered ineffective (388).</p>

    <p>Fantasyland may paint an America that has gone haywire, but Andersen is optimistic that the next generations will be able to “regain [America’s] national balance and composure” (440).</p>
