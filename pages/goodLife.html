        <h1>The Good Life</h1>

    <p>It is a simple fact that every human throughout history has been striving for a good life the moment they were born. Some strive for wealth, as their happiness depends on things they can buy and enjoy. Others strive for fame, as it gives them a sense of completion. This difference in interpreting how a good life should be is not new, as scholars have been asking the same question for centuries. Over the course of Humanities II, there have been three primary sources that demonstrated how different thinkers in different eras interpret “the good life.” They are Summa Theologiae by St. Thomas Aquinas, Merchant of Venice by Shakespeare, and Candide by Voltaire.</p>

    <p>In Summa Theologiae, Aquinas examines various elements that may constitute one’s happiness during the Middle Ages. Aquinas draws a clear distinction between earthly happiness and godly happiness. The former consists of “created” things, or man-made concepts, such as wealth, health, or pleasure, etc. And since humans are sinful by nature, as commonly accepted during Aquinas’ times, these earthly things can never properly satisfy human appetite. Thus, the ultimate happiness, though conceivable, is unachievable. Instead, in order to live a good life, Aquinas stresses that “God alone constitutes man’s happiness,” as God is perfect, and “every creature has goodness by participation” (Aquinas). Considering the clergy’s domination of Europe during this time period, turning to the Church for divine salvation is understandably comforting. Therefore, to Aquinas, a good life is a life strictly devoted to God.</p>

    <p>While Aquinas preaches lifelong happiness to be a divine gift, the Renaissance idea of a good life seems to have gravitated towards human achievements, portrayed prominently in Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice. In the play, a diverse cast embraces diverse concepts of a good life. To Bassanio and the suitors, happiness is Portia’s beauty. To Antonio, happiness is friendship. To Jessica, happiness is to be free from her father’s control. It appears that to be able to live a good life, one ought to be able to enjoy the fruits of the Renaissance such as the economic revival and the recovery of Roman and Greek philosophy and arts. However, these come at the expense of other groups, especially Jews through the portrayal of Shylock, whose implicit suffering is celebrated by Christian characters. As such, a good life is a Christian life, as what the Renaissance has to offer is only available to Christians (Shakespeare).</p>

    <p>With the onset of Enlightenment ideals and the increasing disdain for the Church, the Enlightenment idea of a good life is rooted in science and reason. This idea is shown in Voltaire’s Candide, which tells a story of Candide, an impressionable young man who navigates a world full of greed, injustice and betrayal, propagated by the Old World ideals. In Candide, Voltaire makes it clear that a good life is a life without religion or excessive wealth. For example, the utopian city of El Dorado is quite literally made of gold and precious gems, to which its harmonious populace does not seem to pay much attention. In addition, through the miserable old lady, Voltaire points out the hypocrisy of the Church, stressing the point that one does not need the church to be happy. Furthermore, Voltaire also point how philosophers can be out of touch with reality, evidenced by the misfortune of Pangloss, who maintains a dangerously positive outlook of life, and the conclusion, where everyone stops philosophizing and enjoys life for what it is instead (Voltaire). Thus, Voltaire’s idea of a good life is a humble existence without the temptation of wealth or divine salvation. In other words, a good life is a life of reason.</p>

    <p>It is clear that the collective idea of a good life has evolved and diversified throughout history. Fixed ideas eventually become obsolete. As the world continues to move forward, as new ideas are introduced, perhaps Monty Python has the right idea of a good life, that is to “try and be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try and live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations” (Monty Python’s The Meaning of Life).</p>
