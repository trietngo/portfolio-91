        <h1>Movie Review – “The Merchant of Venice”: The Film versus The Play</h1>
        <p><i>March 8th, 2019</i></p>

    </center>

    <p>The Merchant of Venice is an example of a film adaptation done right. The director Michael Radford has brought Shakespeare’s play to life, with colorful set and costume designs adorning an authentic Renaissance Venice, and a veteran cast consisting of renowned actors and actresses such as Al Pacino of The Godfather fame, Joseph Fiennes, whose acclaimed portrayal of the titular character in Shakespeare In Love has earned him multiple accolades, and Lynn Collins from modern blockbusters such as X-Men Origins: Wolverine and John Carter (IMDB). In addition, the fact these actors and actresses employ Shakespearean English turns the film into a more faithful Hollywood recreation of the literary text. Nonetheless, it is not a carbon copy of the original text, as Radford has made several adjustments that altered the nature of the film, having chosen to focus on the theme of anti-Semitism, and subsequently humanize the character of Shylock as a testament to the evolution of the understanding of Shakespeare’s The Merchant of Venice.</p>

    <p>The first and perhaps the most obvious change is the film’s overt inclusion of anti-Semitism. The film opens with a straightforward disclaimer declaring that “Intolerance of the Jews was a fact of 16th Century life” followed by scenes depicting a Christian preaching against usury, Venetians throwing a Jewish man off the Rialto bridge, and Antonio spitting on Shylock. This introduction in nonexistent in the original text, which begins with Antonio worrying about his merchant ships (Shakespeare, Act 1 Scene 1). Shylock, as a character, does not appear until Act 3.</p>

    <p>It is possible that these new details reflect the character of the director himself, a modern individual with modern sensitivities. The world has changed significantly since Shakespeare first wrote the play. As anti-Semitism is now highly frowned upon, Radford might feel justified to alert the viewers to more troubling layers of Venice beneath the vibrant colors and activities of the Renaissance. The introduction draws a clear line separating the ruling class, represented by Antonio, and the oppressed, represented by Shylock. With such a strong opening contrasting Shakespeare’s gloomy introduction, the film has created justifications for Shylock’s later actions, turning him into a sympathetic character with clear motivations instead of a greedy madman who derives pleasure in taking another person’s flesh. Furthermore, Antonio’s visible contempt towards Jews has cast more shades of gray upon him and his friends as his sacrifice for Bassanio now becomes less commendable.</p>

    <p>Such a prologue has effectively transformed the story into a historical drama, rather than a romantic comedy as Shakespeare has envisioned. While those who favor a strict visual interpretation of the original play may scoff at the creative difference Radford has made, the film is made for a modern audience, rather than an Elizabethan one. As such, the prologue now resonates well with modern viewers, whose contemporary knowledge and perceptions may enable them to appreciate the director’s effort to present an important history lesson as well as including multi-faceted characters and eliciting a degree of sympathy towards them, particularly Shylock. For avid readers of Shakespeare, the film’s acknowledgement of anti-Semitism provides an important context that was missing from the original play, thus enriching the original play even further. All things considered, the addition of a prologue can be perceived as incredibly effective, if not necessary.</p>

    <p>Another visible difference between the film and the text is the existence of an epilogue. In the original play, the story ends happily for the Venetian lovers with Gratiano jokingly vowing to “[keep] safe Nerissa’s ring” with “ring” meaning “gold band” and “vagina,” a clever play on words that is typical of Shakespeare’s comedies (Shakespeare, Act 5, Scene 1). Such a playful ending, however, is missing from the film. Instead, as the main Venetian cast exits the scene, Radford reveals a devastated and now-impoverished Shylock standing in the middle of an empty and dimly lit Venetian street, staring blankly into the camera as guards begin to close the gate to the Belmont mansion. The next scene shows Jessica rushing towards a quiet lagoon at dawn and caressing the turquoise ring that she has stolen from Shylock earlier. In the original play, Shylock disappears after he has declared himself to be “not well” (Shakespeare, Act 4, Scene 1).</p>

    <p>In keeping with the film’s contemporary focus on the discrimination against Jews, the epilogue can be seen as a closure for Shylock, or at the very least an insight of Shylock’s eventual fate. Far from Shylock’s unceremonious departure from the stage in Act 4, the re‑emergence of a devastated Shylock contributes to Radford’s humanization of the character. In addition, such a depiction of Shylock has historical foundations. As he is forced to convert to Christianity, he is now banished from the Jewish ghetto where he would usually be protected (Shakespeare, Scene 4, Act 1; Venice and the Ghetto). His past occupation and his attempt on Antonio’s life are also unlikely to earn him sympathy from the Christian population. Shylock’s blank stare, then, signifies the dark future that awaits him. Furthermore, Shylock’s tragic ending may also be understood as a warning for those Jews who would dare challenge the Christian rulers. As for Jessica, the act of standing on a lagoon by herself and caressing her father’s turquoise ring may be an admission of guilt in contributing to her father’s downfall by marrying Lorenzo, a Christian. It is important to remember that Shylock, as greedy as he is portrayed, keeps the ring as a sentimental reminder of his late wife Leah (Shakespeare, Act 3, Scene 1). The subtlety of Jessica’s remorse, then, gives her character a more caring dimension, different from that of a carefree daughter who wishes for nothing more than to escape from her Jewish household. Through Jessica, the film has re-emphasized the human side of Shylock, a villain with a tragic past.</p>

    <p>Radford’s decision to include such an epilogue can be controversial. Many viewers may deem the epilogue ineffective since its subtlety requires a more in-depth comprehension of the play regarding the turquoise ring. Moreover, the film’s excessive empathy towards Shylock may send a wrong message. As a Jew living under a Christian theocracy, Shylock certainly has motivations to get revenge. However, this does not give him an excuse to harm another person’s life. In this sense, the director has prioritized Shylock over other characters, and thus does not live up to the original focus. Some, however, may still praise the film’s interpretation of Jessica, as she now symbolizes character development and reminds the audience that Shylock is a complicated character. In fact, sympathetic portrayals of Shylock have been a trend since 1815, starting with the performance of Edmund Kean, a celebrated British stage actor (Smith). As such, the final scenes have succeeded in evolving the understanding of Shakespeare’s original play.</p>

    <p>The Merchant of Venice is undoubtedly one of better film adaptations of an original work. Through Michael Radford’s colorful and era-conscious depiction of Shakespearean characters, the film has the potential to become a companion to fans of Shakespeare who also prefer an authentic visual experience.</p>
