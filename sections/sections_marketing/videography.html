            <ul>
                <li>Summer of 2018 is one of the best I’ve ever had, simply because I was being the most productive, working on projects with friends and cool strangers. This short animation was for International Vietnam Model United Nations (IVMUN), a Model UN event that has been quite popular with the Vietnamese youth. Despite my extremely limited experience with animation, this already cool design was made even cooler. The full video, lovingly produced by the IVMUN Media Team, can be watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYEj4GlcmWA">here</a>!</li>
