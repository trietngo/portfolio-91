            <ul>
                <li>As the COVID-19 pandemic was raging on UNI campus, the NISG administration was looking for ways to encourage students to wear masks to reduce the rates of infection. I figured I would make graphics that would look intimidating so that people would be more inclined to think about other people’s health. This was never posted, but it was indeed a fun little project!</li>

                <li>I am eternally grateful for the opportunity to serve as the Director of Public Relations at NISG. I probably created more social media graphics that I ever had, which is not a bad thing at all, considering how barren everything had been before. The following images are my proudest work in the organization. Enjoy!</li>

            <ul>
                <li>As the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election was looming on the horizon, I was tasked with making an infographic explaining how UNI students could vote from UNI campus. This graphic never saw the light of day and I never quite got the explanation why. Nonetheless, it was incredibly fun and educational, especially for an international student like me!</li>

                <li>For two days in mid-February of 2020, I was the Vice Presidential candidate for the Northern Iowa Student Government. Per my running mate’s wish to remain sane and stress-free, we suspended our campaign. Nonetheless, I was extremely proud of the posters I made, and here is one of them!</li>

                <li>For a year, I was the Digital Media Executive of the Service & Leadership Council (SLC) at UNI. My job was to create content to promote the organization’s events tailored to community engagement and leadership. Here are some posters that I particularly enjoyed making. Being a part of SLC made me realize that I could make a difference in the world. Would I do it again, given the chance? Well, what do you think?</li>
